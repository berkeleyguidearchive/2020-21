<p><span>From ancient times to the present day, people around the globe have raised fundamental questions about life through the arts, literature and philosophy. In the Arts &amp; Humanities Division, faculty and students explore the human experience across an exceptionally broad range of subjects. </span></p>
<p>By studying the world’s languages and cultures, students expand their horizons and prepare themselves for an increasingly multicultural world. Through rigorous exploration of complex philosophical arguments, students move beyond their own assumptions toward a deeper understanding of human life and its complexities. And discovery in the arts helps students open their imaginations to fresh perspectives on the world.</p>
<p>The faculty in Arts &amp; Humanities are leaders in their fields — both as researchers, honored worldwide for their contributions to scholarship, and as teachers who challenge students to explore the deepest questions that shape their lives and our times.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://artshumanities.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Arts &amp; Humanities undergraduate website</a> to learn more about the majors, minors and other academic offerings for undergraduates, including undergraduate research and career preparation for Arts &amp; Humanities majors.</p>
