<![CDATA[
<p>Entering the degree mid-career, Master of Public Affairs students are accomplished leaders, managers and executives in their fields with diverse and extensive work experience in the public, non-profit and private sectors. In some cases, students already hold an advanced degree or advanced training in a field. The focus of the degree is on policy analysis combined with deep engagement on questions of organizational leadership, innovation, strategy, and adaptation. The MPA curriculum has been strategically designed to not only equip students with the fundamentals to succeed in policy-driven roles, but also to give them the leadership capabilities necessary to excel. </p>

This course is designed to introduce mid-career executives to three things: a typology of “kinds of problems” that confront those leading organizations; a sampling of major problems confronting leaders in the next decades; and a sampling of solutions to problems confronting leaders. It introduces the rest of the Berkeley MPA summer core program with examples of the kinds of problems that modern leaders must confront and the kinds of solutions</span><span class="deschide"> that must be devised.

There is increasing emphasis throughout the public and non-profit sectors to invest in practices that are “evidence based&quot;. In this course, we are going to study the role of empirical research in public decision making and the common research strategies employed to study problems of causal inference and prediction. The effectiveness of specific intervention often relies on research attempting to demonstrate</span><span class="deschide"> that one variable (for example, a particular educational intervention) has a causal effect on an outcome of interest (for example, successful completion of high school). We will study the various research strategies that are employed to uncover causal effects and to evaluate the effects of programmatic interventions.</span><br/>

Program evaluation is the systematic investigation of social programs, regulations, or policies. The aim of program evaluation is to provide valid findings in order to determine whether a particular program or policy is achieving its objectives. Evaluations are used for various reasons, most commonly to aid in decisions concerning whether programs should be continued, improved, expanded, or curtailed. This course will introduce students to a variety of research</span><span class="deschide"> designs and related methodological tools useful for evaluating the impact of public policies and programs.</span><br/>

Inspirational and authentic leaders understand that in order to inspire and earn the trusts of others, they must first be willing to reveal who they are and what they truly believe in. In this course, we will study how leaders and change agents use storytelling to inspire people and enroll others into their vision. More importantly, you will have the opportunity to discover and tell your own leadership stories—who</span><span class="deschide"> you are, your personal beliefs and values, and your personal/professional aspirations and passion.
