				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Near Eastern Languages and Literatures major offers study in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and the ancient Egyptian language. The major introduces<span> students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the Middle East. Language courses are designed to enhance the student's command of reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension as well as provide students with specialized language skills and expertise that are vital for the global economy. They are often essential preparation for graduate programs too. Students in this major may choose one of the following emphases:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span>An emphasis in a modern language: </span><strong><span>Arabic, </span><span>Hebrew, or </span><span>Persian</span></strong></li>
	<li><span>An emphasis in an ancient language: <strong>Egyptology</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>The department <span>offers modern language instruction at </span>elementary to advanced levels <span>in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish (minor only). </span>Instructors are trained in contemporary teaching methods, using the latest classroom technologies and a range of multi-media tools to provide engaging and exciting classroom instruction. The major is intended to <span>help students prepare for travel abroad or for a </span><span>career that requires language fluency. A </span><span>major in the Near Eastern languages allow students to be </span><span>part of a close-knit group of language enthusiasts and </span><span>ensures that each student will receive the </span><span>best </span>training for their future goals. <span>The major prepares students for professions in </span><span>foreign service, political and </span><span>international affairs, comparative studies, translation services, teaching and research, and for </span><span>further study in graduate programs</span>.</p>
<p><span>For specific information regarding degree requirements for each emphasis, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page. </span>Please note the Egyptology major is currently under review for updates and revisions. For more information about Egyptology major requirements, please contact the undergraduate major advisor. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students are recommended to declare the major early in their academic careers. Near Eastern Studies 10 is a required lower division course, which may be taken after declaring the major. Students should consult with the undergraduate student advisor regarding major requirements, transfer credits, study abroad plans, and the opportunity to combine two disciplines through a double major study.  </p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students in any of the Near Eastern Studies majors, with an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher and a GPA of 3.51 or higher in courses completed in the major, may apply for admission to the honors program in their senior year. Students must maintain the required GPA in the major in order to remain eligible for the honors program. </p>
<p>In addition to the GPA requirement, students must submit an honors thesis of at least 20 double-spaced, typewritten pages in their senior year. Students are required to enroll in an Independent Study course (NES 199) in the fall semester and the honors course (<a href="/2020-21/search/?P=NE%20STUD%20H195">NE STUD H195</a>) in the spring semester of their senior year in order to receive credit for the thesis. The honors thesis must be read and evaluated by a two-member committee consisting of a department faculty thesis supervisor and another member of the faculty. The thesis must be deemed to be of at least B+ quality in order to qualify the candidate for graduation with a degree of honors. Students may also receive distinctions of &quot;high honors&quot; or &quot;highest honors&quot; for outstanding thesis papers. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Near Eastern Studies Department also offers programs leading to a minor in modern Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, or Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Civilizations. </p>

In addition to the lower division language requirements, <span class="sc_courseinline">NE STUD 10</span> is a required course for the major and must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
<p>Please note the Egyptology major is currently under review for updates and revisions. For more information about the Egyptology major requirements, please contact the undergraduate major advisor. </p>
