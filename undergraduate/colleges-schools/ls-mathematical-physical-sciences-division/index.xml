<![CDATA[  
<p>With a full-time faculty of about 160, the Division of Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences seeks to expand our physical and mathematical understanding of the universe, from its microscopic substructure to its largest structures, from our own Earth to the edge of the universe and the beginning of time. The language used is mathematical. Discovery and understanding advance by the interplay between theory and experiment or observation.</p>
