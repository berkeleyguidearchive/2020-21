				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>The School of Public Health offers two professional degrees, the Master of Public Health (MPH) and the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH). The School of Public Health also offers academic degrees in <a href="/archive/2020-21/graduate/degree-programs/biostatistics/">Biostatistics</a> (MA, PhD), <a href="/archive/2020-21/graduate/degree-programs/environmental-health-sciences/">Environmental Health Sciences</a> (MS, PhD), <a href="/archive/2020-21/graduate/degree-programs/epidemiology/">Epidemiology</a> (MS, PhD), <a href="/archive/2020-21/graduate/degree-programs/health-medical-sciences-program/">Health and Medical Sciences</a> (MS), <a href="/archive/2020-21/graduate/degree-programs/health-policy/">Health Policy</a> (PhD), and <a href="/archive/2020-21/graduate/degree-programs/infectious-diseases-immunity/">Infectious Diseases &amp; Immunity</a> (PhD).</p>
<h3>Master of Public Health (MPH)</h3>
<p>The program of study leading to the professional MPH degree is based on a series of foundation courses. In addition, MPH students concentrate in one of the following areas: Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences, Epidemiology, Epidemiology/Biostatistics, Health and Social Behavior, Health Policy and Management, Global Health and Environment, Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, Interdisciplinary, Maternal and Child Health, and Public Health Nutrition.</p>
<p>The MPH degree is available in a residential program on campus or through an <a href="http://onlinemph.berkeley.edu/"><span class="s2">On-Campus/Online MPH</span></a> program. The hybrid program requires two accelerated on-campus sessions, while all remaining coursework is completed online.</p>
<h3>Doctor of Public Health (DrPH)</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/areas-study/doctor-public-health">Doctor of Public Health (DrPH)</a> curriculum is based on a comprehensive body of knowledge in the field of public health and its related disciplines, and the investigation of significant problems in public health practice.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="admissionstext"></a><h2>Admissions</h2><h3>Admission to the University</h3>
 <h4>Minimum Requirements for Admission</h4> <p>The following minimum requirements apply to all graduate programs and will be verified by the Graduate Division:</p> <ol> 	<li>A bachelor’s degree or recognized equivalent from an accredited institution;</li> 	<li>A grade point average of B or better (3.0);</li> 	<li>If the applicant comes from a country or political entity (e.g., Quebec) where English is not the official language, adequate proficiency in English to do graduate work, as evidenced by a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the iBT test, 570 on the paper-and-pencil test, or an IELTS Band score of at least 7 on a 9-point scale (note that individual programs may set higher levels for any of these); and</li> 	<li>Sufficient undergraduate training to do graduate work in the given field.</li> </ol> <h4>Applicants Who Already Hold a Graduate Degree</h4> <p>The Graduate Council views academic degrees not as vocational training certificates, but as evidence of broad training in research methods, independent study, and articulation of learning. Therefore, applicants who already have academic graduate degrees should be able to pursue new subject matter at an advanced level without the need to enroll in a related or similar graduate program.</p> <p>Programs may consider students for an additional academic master’s or professional master’s degree only if the additional degree is in a distinctly different field.</p> <p>Applicants admitted to a doctoral program that requires a master’s degree to be earned at Berkeley as a prerequisite (even though the applicant already has a master’s degree from another institution in the same or a closely allied field of study) will be permitted to undertake the second master’s degree, despite the overlap in field.</p> <p>The Graduate Division will admit students for a second doctoral degree only if they meet the following guidelines:</p> <ol> 	<li>Applicants with doctoral degrees may be admitted for an additional doctoral degree only if that degree program is in a general area of knowledge distinctly different from the field in which they earned their original degree. For example, a physics PhD could be admitted to a doctoral degree program in music or history; however, a student with a doctoral degree in mathematics would not be permitted to add a PhD in statistics.</li> 	<li>Applicants who hold the PhD degree may be admitted to a professional doctorate or professional master’s degree program if there is no duplication of training involved.</li> </ol> <p>Applicants may apply only to one single degree program or one concurrent degree program per admission cycle.</p> <h4>Required Documents for Applications</h4> <ol> 	<li><strong>Transcripts: </strong>Applicants may upload <em>unofficial </em>transcripts with your application for the departmental initial review. <em>If the applicant is admitted,</em> then <em>official </em>transcripts of all college-level work will be required. Official transcripts must be in sealed envelopes as issued by the school(s) attended. If you have attended Berkeley, upload your unofficial transcript with your application for the departmental initial review. <em>If you are admitted,</em> an official transcript with evidence of degree conferral <em>will not</em> be required.</li> 	<li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Applicants may request online letters of recommendation through the online application system. Hard copies of recommendation letters must be sent directly to the program, not the Graduate Division.</li> 	<li><strong>Evidence of English language proficiency:</strong> All applicants from countries or political entities in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency. This applies to applicants from Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and Quebec (Canada). However, applicants who, at the time of application, have already completed at least one year of full-time academic course work with grades of B or better at a US university may submit an official transcript from the US university to fulfill this requirement. The following courses will not fulfill this requirement: 	<ul> 		<li>courses in English as a Second Language,</li> 		<li>courses conducted in a language other than English,</li> 		<li>courses that will be completed after the application is submitted, and</li> 		<li>courses of a non-academic nature.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol> <p style="margin-left:40px">If applicants have previously been denied admission to Berkeley on the basis of their English language proficiency, they must submit new test scores that meet the current minimum from one of the standardized tests. <span>Official TOEFL score reports must be sent directly from Educational Test Services (ETS). The institution code for Berkeley is 4833. Official IELTS score reports must be mailed directly to our office from the British Council. TOEFL and IELTS score reports are only valid for two years.</span></p> <h4>Where to Apply</h4> <p>Visit the Berkeley Graduate Division <a href="http://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/" target="_blank">application page</a>. </p>

<h3>Concurrent Degree Requirements</h3>
<h5><a id="Health Social MPH-MCP" name="Health Social MPH-MCP">Health &amp; Social Behavior (MPH-MCP)</a></h5>
<p class="text-intro">This concurrent degree program is designed to examine research, practice, and policy at the intersection of urban planning, policy and design with population health. Special attention is given to understanding the forces that are shaping urbanization in the US and globally, what methods are necessary to analyze the relationships between urban policy and planning and human health, and to design and analyze interventions, frequently in partnership with community members and organizations, that can enhance urban health equity. The program prepares students for interdisciplinary careers in such fields as urban development, community health, housing, transportation, policymaking, and others. Graduates secure jobs working in government, international organizations, non-profits, academia/research and the private sector.</p>
<p>Candidates for this program are recruited and admitted through both the School of Public Health and the Department of City and Regional Planning. Students complete the core curriculum of each area, as well as a track within MPH and an area of concentration in MCP. Visit the <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/city-regional-planning/programs/concurrent-programs/public-health/">City and Regional Planning website</a> for more information.</p>
<h5><a id="Public Health Journalism MPH-MJ" name="Public Health Journalism MPH-MJ">Public Health and Journalism (MPH-MJ)</a></h5>
<p class="text-intro">The three-year MPH/MJ allows students to combine their interests in public health, journalism, communications and media. The program is designed to produce public health professionals who are effective media practitioners and communicators as well as journalists with the training and knowledge necessary to cover public health and medical issues for online, print, broadcast and other media platforms.</p>
<p>Students select one of four public health concentrations (environmental health, infectious diseases, epidemiology/biostatistics, health and social behavior) and simultaneously develop their reporting and multimedia skills.

<p class="text-intro">The MBA/MPH program provides a deep competency in business administration, integrated with up-to-the-minute knowledge of health policy and management and other health care concepts. Students in this program pursue a wide range of interests including global health, entrepreneurship/start-ups, biotech/medtech, provider and payer initiatives, and social impact. This track allows students to have an extended period at Berkeley to take more electives, develop business and leadership skills in a range of applied health care settings, and have two distinct full-time summer internships.</p>
<p>This is a 2.5-year concurrent degree program, offered in a long-standing partnership between Berkeley Public Health and the Haas School of Business. It has been in existence for more than 35 years, so it has a large community of alumni and provides students access to the top-notch career services and faculty mentors from both Schools</p>

In the past decade, health systems and their role in global health have received increasing focus. While disease-focused, 'vertical programs', such as malaria and HIV/AIDs still command the lion's share of donor resources, it has become clear that the sustainability of disease programs depends on embedding them into a country's health system. This course provides a real world, practical understanding of health systems, based on a solid academic</span><span class="deschide"> foundation.

This is an interdisciplinary course which will adopt a broad-based ecological perspective of health and behavior. This class will emphasize the interconnected and multidirectional relationships between biology, behavior, and the social environment. This course will be conducted as a seminar series (with a focus on biological processes). We will investigate the assertion that biological, psychological, and social processes interact over a lifetime</span><span class="deschide"> to influence health and vulnerability to disease (a developmental epigenetic perspective). Rather than focusing on &quot;if&quot; social factors can influence health and disease we will focus on &quot;how&quot; social factors may regulate/change biological measures. Three very general themes will be addressed: development, &quot;social&quot; neuroscience and gene-environment interactions as they relate to behavior. Topics such as constraints/plasticity and behavior, genetic determinism, vulnerability versus resilience, gene-environment interactions, fetal/developmental programming, and stress will all be touched upon.</span><br/>

In this class, we will construct a framework to formulate explanations for health care disparities and to construct responses that have the potential for a policy-oriented, and therefore widespread, response. Taking advantage of selected developments in social science theory and research that can provide insight into how health care disparities come about, we will draw from anthropological and psychological theories of cultural orientation</span><span class="deschide">, cultural framing of problems, and cultural identity; as well as drawing from psychological theories of stress and coping. We also will draw from sociological theories of individual and community poverty, and theories characterizing health care system design and service delivery.</span><br/>

Topics include causal inference; measurement of disease rates; inferential reasoning; and research study designs including ecologic, case-control, cohort, intervention trials, and meta-analytic designs (potential sources of bias, confounding, and effect modification in each research design are explored in depth); topics in clinical epidemiology including the</span><span class="deschide"> use of likelihood ratios, receiver operator curves, and the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of a test; and a brief introduction to logistic regression, survival analysis, and decision analysis. The readings from this course are drawn primarily from advanced epidemiology textbooks (Kleinbuam, Rothman, Miettinen). The course is intended to provide a firm foundation for students who will subsequently enroll in 250C.</span><br/>

This course is designed to review, evaluate, and apply methods currently used in the field of social epidemiology. The course aims to teach approaches to forming clear research questions, and selecting the best method(s) to answer the questions posed. Initially we will discuss approaches to defining clear and specific research questions. We will then discuss recent controversies around the meaning of questions posed in social epidemiology</span><span class="deschide">, and the ability of currently used methods to answer questions in social epidemiology. Finally we will review, evaluate, and apply a range of different methods that are or could be used to answer questions in social epidemiology, again emphasizing the types of questions answered by these methods, and their ability to address the challenges to effectively answering questions in social epidemiology. There will be a mixture of discussion and lecture depending on the topic, with student participation and questions strongly encouraged.</span><br/>

This course will be the principal immunology course for students in the field of public health. It is designed to teach both the basic biology of the human immune system and its response in health and disease, especially the specific response of the human immune system to major human pathogens. Four areas will be explored: 1) components of the immune system (spectrum of cell types and cell products); 2) different arms of the immune system including</span><span class="deschide"> humoral, cell-mediated, innate, and mucosal immunity; 3) specific immune response to infection caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens; and 4) disorders of the immune system unrelated to infectious disease. Through this course, students should not only gain a basic understanding of the human immune system, but also learn the functions and responses of the human immune system to diseases of infectious and non-infectious nature, and the relevance of these interactions in the context of public health problems.</span><br/>

The workplace is commonly viewed as a setting for health promotion of individual behavior change, while its potential to be a source of critical exposures that directly impact health, safety &amp; well-being of working populations is often overlooked. Purpose of the class is to help public health practitioners build a framework for understanding the role that work &amp; workplace conditions play</span><span class="deschide"> in individual &amp; community health, to introduce strategies that address work-related health inequities &amp; facilitate the development of concrete skills in these areas. The course emphasizes worker &amp; community organization &amp; participation in effecting social justice &amp; public health change.</span><br/>

Geographic information systems (GIS) have emerged as an important tool for performing health and environmental analyses. GIS is generally seen as a spatial analysis system for the organization, storage, retrieval, and analysis of data for which the location and other spatial attributes are considered important (e.g., incidence of a specific disease condition in relation to a pollution source). GIS also encompasses the organizational structure</span><span class="deschide">, personnel, software, and hardware needed to support spatial analysis. For many health and social scientists, GIS has evolved into a new lens for viewing their work. The course will provide students with an introduction to this exciting and expanding field of inquiry. On successful completion of the course you should possess the following skills and knowledge: 1) A basic understanding of the fundamental geographic and cartographic concepts that underlie GIS. 2) Working knowledge of ArcGIS, a powerful &quot;desktop&quot; GIS software package that runs in a Windows environment. 3) Introductory knowledge of past, present, and possible future applications of GIS for health and environmental studies.</span><br/>
