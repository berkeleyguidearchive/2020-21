				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Near Eastern Civilizations major explores the civilizations of the Near and Middle East through critical analysis of its cultural, literary, artistic, historic, and archaeological evidence. This major offers an interdisciplinary approach across various academic disciplines to provide both a theoretical and a research-based study of societies from prehistoric to modern times. The major offers one of two emphases:  </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ancient Near Eastern Civilizations </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Islamic Civilization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Ancient Near East</strong> (Middle East) is considered to be the <span>cradle of civilization, where cities</span><span> and empires first emerged, agriculture developed, the invention of the wheel made, </span><span>the first writing systems formed, foundations established in </span>astronomy and mathematics, and discoveries made of ancient literary masterpieces considered to be the roots of Western Civilization. <span>Students will explore the principal civilizations of the Near East </span><span>studying the human experience </span>as it unfolds in<span> documents, monuments, and architectural marvels and to further investigate these ancient artifacts in modern times through the use of cutting edge technology. </span><span>The major prepares students in the fields of archaeology, digital humanities, teaching and research, museum studies, and for further study in graduate programs.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span><strong>The Islamic Civilization</strong> major provides a broad knowledge of the histories, literature, philosophy, religious thought, and legal institutions of Muslim societies. Expanding from the Middle East, the Islamic civilization has had a profound historical impact on practically every part of the world and continues to be an important area of academic inquiry on account of its political, economic, and cultural effects on the international arena. This major emphasizes an interdisciplinary course study allowing for a </span>historical, cultural, and literary analysis<span> from medieval to modern times. The major prepares students in the fields of comparative and international studies, foreign service, law, teaching and research, and for further study in graduate programs. </span></p>
<p><span>For specific information regarding degree requirements for each emphasis, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</span></p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students are recommended to declare the major early in their academic career. Near Eastern Studies 10 is a required lower division course but may be taken after declaring the major. Students should consult with the undergraduate student adviser regarding major requirements, transfer credits, study abroad plans, and the opportunity to combine two disciplines through a double major study.  </p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students in any of the Near Eastern Studies majors, with an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher and a GPA of 3.51 or higher in courses completed in the major, may apply for admission to the honors program in their senior year. Students must maintain the required GPA in the major in order to remain eligible for the honors program. </p>
<p>In addition to the GPA requirement, students must submit an honors thesis of at least 20 double-spaced, typewritten pages in their senior year. Students are required to enroll in an Independent Study course (NES 199) in the fall semester and the honors course (<a href="/2020-21/search/?P=NE%20STUD%20H195">NE STUD H195</a>) in the spring semester of their senior year in order to receive credit for the thesis. The honors thesis must be read and evaluated by a two-member committee consisting of a department faculty thesis supervisor and another member of the faculty. The thesis must be deemed to be of at least B+ quality in order to qualify the candidate for graduation with a degree of honors. Students may also receive distinctions of &quot;high honors&quot; or &quot;highest honors&quot; for outstanding thesis papers. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Near Eastern Studies Department also offers programs leading to a minor in modern Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, or Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Civilizations. </p>
