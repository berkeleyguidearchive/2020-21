				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>UC Berkeley’s Energy and Resources Group (ERG) confers an interdisciplinary Undergraduate Minor in Energy and Resources and a Summer Minor/Certificate in Sustainability, as well as graduate M.A., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees.</p>
<p>Energy and Resources Group research and courses empha­size science-based knowl­edge of the envi­ron­men­tal con­se­quences of resource use; ana­lyt­i­cal tools that pro­mote effi­ciency, con­ser­va­tion, afford­abil­ity, and equity in energy and resource use; and  under­stand­ing of the social and insti­tu­tional con­texts in which resource and envi­ron­men­tal prob­lems arise, and in which cre­ative and eth­i­cal solu­tions can be sus­tained. It is this syn­the­sis of basic sci­ence, prac­ti­cal problem-solving, and con­struc­tive social cri­tique that defines ERG.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://erg.berkeley.edu/">Energy and Resources Group website</a> for more information about our undergraduate minors and graduate programs.</p>
<h4><strong>Energy and Resources Minor</strong></h4>
<p>The Energy and Resources Minor offers knowl­edge and skills to enable matriculated UC Berkeley undergraduates to address the com­plex and inter­de­pen­dent issues asso­ci­ated with the inter­ac­tion of social, eco­nomic, polit­i­cal, tech­ni­cal, and envi­ron­men­tal fac­tors. Stu­dents in any major may add the Energy and Resources minor, which is composed of two core and three elective upper division courses. Several of these courses require preparation in mathematics or science.</p>
<h4><strong>Summer Sustainability Minor</strong></h4>
<p>Whatever direction your studies take you, the Energy and Resources Summer Minor or Certificate in Sustainability will equip you with tools to tackle some of the most pressing issues facing the world today. This program offers a practical and relevant interdisciplinary approach at the intersection of environmental, economic, social, political, and cultural issues.</p>
<p>Students in the interdisciplinary Summer Minor in Sustainability will learn about:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The science, engineering, economics, and policy of renewable energy</li>
	<li>Biodiversity, environmental degradation, and the science behind climate change</li>
	<li>The business and economics of environmental sustainability</li>
	<li>Environmental change and social justice</li>
</ul>
<p>The Summer Minor or Certificate in Sustainability is open to matriculated UC Berkeley undergraduates, students from other institutions, and the general public. Upon completion, UC Berkeley undergraduates receive a Minor in Sustainability, while other participants receive a Certificate in Sustainability from UC Berkeley. Visit the <a href="http://erg.berkeley.edu/">Energy and Resources Group website</a> for more information.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://erg.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Group Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><h4><!--class="Mso"--><!--class="Mso"-->The Energy and Resources Minor</h4>
<p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h5>General Guidelines</h5>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit, <span id="docs-internal-guid-9effb8f5-7fff-d2ad-071a-eb9bd5113ccf">except for courses taken in spring or summer 2020, when students will be allowed to take courses Pass/No Pass</span>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>At least four upper division courses must be taken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Declaring the Minor</strong></h5>
<p>Students interested in pursuing the Energy and Resources minor should submit an Intent to Declare the Minor form during the semester in which upper division minor coursework is started. For information on how to submit your intent to pursue the minor, courses that fulfill the minor, how common lower division prerequisites may be completed, and how to declare the minor once completed, please visit the <a href="http://erg.berkeley.edu/academics/program/#undergrad" target="_blank">ERG website</a>.</p>
<h5>Requirements FOR THE eNERGY AND rESOURCES mINOR</h5>
<p>Students have or will develop strong foundations in math, physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>
<p>There are no lower division courses required for the Energy and Resources Minor; however in some cases lower division coursework is required in order to be enrolled in the upper division courses.</p>
<p>Many of the Energy and Resources minor upper division courses have prerequisites such as: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%201A" title="MATH 1A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 1A');">MATH 1A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%201B" title="MATH 1B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 1B');">MATH 1B</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2016A" title="MATH 16A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 16A');">MATH 16A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2016B" title="MATH 16B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 16B');">MATH 16B</a></span>; <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PHYSICS%207A" title="PHYSICS 7A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PHYSICS 7A');">PHYSICS 7A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PHYSICS%207B" title="PHYSICS 7B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PHYSICS 7B');">PHYSICS 7B</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PHYSICS%208A" title="PHYSICS 8A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PHYSICS 8A');">PHYSICS 8A</a></span>- <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PHYSICS%208B" title="PHYSICS 8B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PHYSICS 8B');">PHYSICS 8B</a></span>; <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CHEM%201A" title="CHEM 1A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CHEM 1A');">CHEM 1A</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CHEM%204A" title="CHEM 4A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CHEM 4A');">CHEM 4A</a></span>; and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201B" title="BIOLOGY 1B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'BIOLOGY 1B');">BIOLOGY 1B</a></span></p>

<h5>Electives</h5>
<p>The choice of electives should be made with two goals in mind: exploring the range of approaches available to address energy and resource issues and complementing the student's major. The latter can be achieved by adding relevant depth in closely related areas or by exploring methods and approaches that contrast with the tools and knowledge base employed in the major. Students are encouraged to discuss their program with the Energy and Resources minor advisor.</p>
<p>The following courses have been approved, but students should contact the Energy and Resources minor advisor to request approval of alternate courses. At least four upper division courses must be taken at Berkeley.</p>

This course introduces students to water policy in developing countries. It is a course motivated by the fact that over one billion people in developing countries have no access to safe drinking water, three billion do not have sanitation facilities, and many millions of small farmers do not have reliable water supplies to ensure a healthy crop. Readings and discussions will cover: the problems of water access and use in developing countries;</span><span class="deschide"> the potential for technological, social, and economic solutions to these problems; the role of institutions in access to water and sanitation; and the pitfalls of the assumptions behind some of today's popular &quot;solutions.&quot;</span><br/>

This course is a self-contained introduction to the economics of climate change. Climate change is caused by a large variety of economic activities, and many of its impacts will have economic consequences. Economists have studied climate change for more than two decades, and economic arguments are often powerful in policy decisions. The course will familiarize students with these arguments and equip them with the tools to participate</span><span class="deschide"> in discussions of climate change policy through an economic lens.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course will start with a brief review of the science of climate change, discuss scenarios of economic growth and the greenhouse gas emissions caused by economic activities and investigate various emission reduction opportunities and their economic costs. A significant amount of time will be spent on studying the impacts of climate change, their economic evaluation and how adaptation can lower the costs of climate damages.<br/>
<br/>We will then study various theoretical frameworks economists have developed that answer the question how estimates about the costs and benefits of climate policy can be combined to find “good” climate policies. We then study three more specialized topics that turn out to be of great importance when analyzing climate change policy: first, how do we compare costs and benefits of generations that live many centuries apart? Second, how do we design climate policy when our projections of both the costs and the benefits of climate policy are highly uncertain? And third, how can equity considerations be accounted for in an economic assessment of climate change policy? The course will close with a look at international cooperation on climate policy and why it has been so difficult to agree on effective treatises that implement climate change policy.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will also have gained insight into the practical aspects of modeling the economics of climate change by building a simple integrated assessment model in Excel. They will be able to use that model to do simple analysis of climate change policy themselves.<br/>
Students will be familiar with the tools economists use to analyze climate change policy. They will have studied empirical estimates of the costs and benefits of climate policy and have an understanding of the analytical issues that drive research on the economics of climate change.</p></div>

Economists through history have explored economic and environmental interactions, physical limits to growth, what constitutes the good life, and how economic justice can be assured. Yet economists continue to use measures and models that simplify these issues and promote bad outcomes.
