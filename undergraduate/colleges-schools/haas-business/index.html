<h2>Introduction to the College</h2>




<p>As the second-oldest business school in the United States, the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley is one of the world's leading producers of new ideas and knowledge in all areas of business.</p>




<p>At Haas, teamwork and collaboration are the hallmark of the undergraduate program. Entering the program in cohorts, students are members of a close-knit, supportive peer network. Through their diversity of ideas and backgrounds and shared experiences at Haas, they build bonds that will last a lifetime.</p>




<p>The Haas School of Business offers an outstanding business administration program to about 700 undergraduate students each year. Haas undergraduates study with faculty who are leading experts in their fields. The Haas Undergraduate Program gives students the knowledge and skills needed to embark in today’s business world.</p>




<p>The school’s mission is “to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.” The school’s distinctive culture is defined by four defining leadership principles:</p>




<ul>
	<li>Question the status quo</li>
	<li>Confidence without attitude</li>
	<li>Students always</li>
	<li>Beyond yourself</li>
</ul>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework.

The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement.

<h3>Experiential Learning Program</h3>
<p>The Haas Undergraduate Program Office is proud to offer undergraduate students the ability to gain practical skills through the Experiential Learning Program workshops which are conducted throughout the academic year. Open to Haas undergraduate majors only, these non-credit workshops provide opportunities to enhance the students’ personal growth beyond the classroom setting. Workshops usually focus on one topic of general interest (i.e. Corporate Valuation) and are conducted by professional facilitators during 1 or 2 weekend days.</p>
<p>Below is a sample of some of the workshops and their brief descriptions. <strong>Actual workshop topics may vary and the semester in which they are offered may change.</strong></p>
<h3>Typical Workshops</h3>
<p><em>Finance Interview Training and Financial Statement Analysis</em> - This seminar introduces the terminology and approaches of financial statement analysis and to assist candidates seeking employment in any occupation involving financial statement analysis.</p>
<p><em>Introduction to Corporate Valuation</em> - Assists candidates seeking employment on Wall Street and in their field of finance. Through practical examples and exercises, the seminar illustrates the fundamentals of popular valuation techniques used by Wall Street practitioners.</p>
<p><em>Fundamentals of Financial Modeling</em> - Designed to develop financial modeling skills through actual hands-on construction of a financial model. Each participant will build their own interactive financial model from “scratch” to practice blending accounting, finance and Excel skills.</p>
<p><em>Mergers and Acquisitions/Leveraged Buyout</em> – Includes a conceptual discussion of both areas and hands on practical experiences in both merger analysis and leveraged buyout analysis. This session will give students the opportunity to build a standalone one page model for each area.</p>
<h3>Student Organizations</h3>
<p>Student organizations offer important services and activities for undergraduates. Each Haas-sponsored organization offers students a unique service or caters to a particular professional interest within the broad field of business. Haas values the co-curricular activities and experiential learning provided by these <a href="https://berkeleyhbsa.org/hso" target="_blank">sponsored organizations.</a> </p>
