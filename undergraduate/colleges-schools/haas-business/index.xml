<p><em>Fundamentals of Financial Modeling</em> - Designed to develop financial modeling skills through actual hands-on construction of a financial model. Each participant will build their own interactive financial model from “scratch” to practice blending accounting, finance and Excel skills.</p>
<p><em>Mergers and Acquisitions/Leveraged Buyout</em> – Includes a conceptual discussion of both areas and hands on practical experiences in both merger analysis and leveraged buyout analysis. This session will give students the opportunity to build a standalone one page model for each area.</p>
