This course will study the end of life--dying and death--from the perspective of medicine and history. It seeks to confront the humanist with the quotidian dilemmas of modern clinical practice and medicine's deep engagement with death more generally. It invites pre-med, pre-law, and public policy students to understand these matters in light of the historical and, more broadly, literary and artistic perspectives</span><span class="deschide"> of the humanities.</span><br />

This course's goal is to provide a method for medical students to think, write about, and discuss feelings engendered by clinical encounters. Medical students are taught the need to be emotionally detached from patients, yet being emotionally detached does not mean devoid of emotion. This course offers a means to express and analyze those feelings. Also considered is the value of regarding the medical history as &quot;text&quot; which can</span><span class="deschide"> be written and read from differing, equally valid viewpoints.</span><br />
