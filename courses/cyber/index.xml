This course explores the most important elements beyond technology that shape the playing field on which cybersecurity problems emerge and are managed. The course emphasizes how ethical, legal, and economic frameworks enable and constrain security technologies and policies. It introduces some of the most important macro-elements (such as national security considerations and interests of nation-states) and micro-elements (such as behavioral economic insights into</span><span class="deschide"> how people understand and interact with security features). Specific topics include policymaking, business models, legal frameworks, national security considerations, ethical issues, standards making, and the roles of users, government, and industry.</span><br/>

This course focuses on both mathematical and practical foundations of cryptography. The course discusses asymmetric and symmetric cryptography, Kerchkoff’s Principle, chosen and known plaintext attacks, public key infrastructure, X.509, SSL/TLS (https), and authentication protocols. The course will include an in-depth discussion of many different cryptosystems including the RSA, Rabin, DES, AES, Elliptic Curve, and SHA family cryptosystems. This course also introduces</span><span class="deschide"> advanced topics of applied cryptography, including a brief introduction to homomorphic encrypted computation and secure multi-party computation to protect sensitive data during arbitrary computation, cryptocurrency and its cryptographic building blocks, and quantum computing.</span><br/>

This course offers valuable perspective for both the non-technical business manager and the technical cybersecurity or IT manager. It is the vital connector between the technical world of threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits, and the business world of board-level objectives, enterprise risk management, and organizational leadership. Now more than ever, managers have a need and responsibility to understand cyber risk. Just as financial risks</span><span class="deschide"> and other operational risks have to be effectively managed within an organization, cyber risk has to be managed. It spans far beyond information technology, with broad implications in the areas of organizational behavior, financial risk modeling, legal issues, and executive leadership.</span><br/>

This course surveys privacy mechanisms applicable to systems engineering, with a particular focus on the inference threat arising due to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. We will briefly discuss the history of privacy and compare two major examples of general legal frameworks for privacy from the United States and the European Union. We then survey three design frameworks of privacy that may be used to guide the</span><span class="deschide"> design of privacy-aware information systems. Finally, we survey threat-specific technical privacy frameworks and discuss their applicability in different settings, including statistical privacy with randomized responses, anonymization techniques, semantic privacy models, and technical privacy mechanisms.</span><br/>

A variety of actors exploit government and private networks, systems, and data. Perpetrators target these systems to engage in cybercrime, espionage, disinformation campaigns, disruption of essential services, destruction of critical infrastructure, and the deletion, theft, or alteration of data.

This course provides students with real-world experience assisting politically vulnerable organizations and persons around the world to develop and implement sound cybersecurity practices. In the classroom, students study basic theories and practices of digital security, intricacies of protecting largely under-resourced organizations, and tools needed to manage risk in complex political, sociological, legal, and ethical contexts. In the clinic</span><span class="deschide">, students work in teams supervised by Clinic staff to provide direct cybersecurity assistance to civil society organizations. We emphasize pragmatic, workable solutions that take into account the unique needs of each partner organization.</span><br/>
