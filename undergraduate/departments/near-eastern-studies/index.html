<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>Instruction in the Department of Near Eastern Studies (NES) is concerned with the languages, literatures, and civilizations of the ancient, medieval, and modern Near and Middle East. The department offers specialized training in archaeology, art history, Assyriology, Egyptology, Iranian studies, Judaic studies, Islamic studies, comparative Semitics, and Turkish, Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian languages and literatures. Lecture courses offered by the department present a comprehensive body of information on past Near and modern Middle Eastern civilizations. For students in other disciplines, the department provides a wide variety of courses to supplement related fields including anthropology, linguistics, art history, history, political science, comparative literature, and folklore. Courses in the department are often small to medium-sized and afford students an opportunity for close interaction with the instructing staff.</p>




<p>The Department of Near Eastern Studies offers the following undergraduate majors:</p>




<ul>
	<li>The Major in Near Eastern Languages and Literatures (emphasis in a Modern Language: Arabic, Hebrew, or Persian; and emphasis in an Ancient Language: Egyptology)</li>
	<li>The Major in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Art and Archaeology (emphasis in Ancient Near Eastern Art and Archaeology and emphasis in Egyptian Art and Archaeology)</li>
	<li>The Major in Near Eastern Civilizations (emphasis in Ancient Near Eastern Civilizations and emphasis in Islamic Civilizations)</li>
</ul>




<p>Minors are also available in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Civilizations and in the modern languages taught in the department.</p>




<a name="libraries"></a>
<h3>Libraries</h3>




<p>The Near Eastern Studies libraries are essential parts of the Department of Near Eastern Studies. These non-circulating libraries are important for research for both graduate and undergraduate students in the department. <span>The libraries house reference materials relating to the various disciplines within NES, as well as more general monographs and serials, and serve as seminar classrooms. </span></p>




<p><span>The <strong>Hebrew/Semitics Library</strong> and the <strong>Islamic Studies Library</strong> both contain basic reference materials, including dictionaries and encyclopedias, and some of the most important texts in their fields. Access is generally limited to graduate students in the department. Both libraries are non-circulating. </span></p>




<p>The <strong>Baer-Keller Library of Egyptology</strong> is a non-circulating collection of approximately 9,000 volumes maintained by the Near Eastern Studies Department primarily for the use of UC Berkeley students and faculty pursuing serious study of Ancient Egyptian culture, Coptology, and Papyrology. Egyptology students and professionals from other institutions are also welcome. Interested individuals should apply to the Near Eastern Studies Department. <span>The core of the library collection comes from bequests to the Department of Near Eastern Studies by Professors Klaus Baer (1987) and Cathleen (Candy) Keller (2008). Professor Baer was an Associate Professor of Egyptology and History at UC Berkeley before becoming a Professor of Egyptology at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. Professor Keller was an Associate Professor of Egyptology at UC Berkeley for many years.</span></p>




<p>Cooperative arrangements between the University and the nearby Graduate Theological Union enable students in the department to use the extensive library holdings of the Union and supplement their programs with selected courses in Palestinian archaeology, Biblical studies, and Semitic epigraphy and philology.</p>

This introductory course will cover both the study of the classical Syriac language and a more general introduction to Syriac literature in all its diversity, with particular emphasis on East Syriac. Syriac is both an ancient tongue that can help us access older Christian histories as well as a living language within the liturgy of current Christian communities, such as the Assyrians. For some communities, Syriac is close to the living vernacular language. Undergraduate</span><span class="deschide"> students will read Christian narratives developed in the Middle East from as far back as 1600 years ago.</span><br/>
